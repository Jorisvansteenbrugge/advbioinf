# Enumerating Oriented Gene Orderings
# ===================================
# 
# A signed permutation of length n is some ordering of the positive integers
# {1,2,,n} in which each integer is then provided with either a positive or
# negative sign (for the sake of simplicity, we omit the positive sign). For
# example, =(5,3,2,1,4) is a signed permutation of length 5.
# 
# Given: A positive integer n6.
# 
# Return: The total number of signed permutations of length n, followed by a list
# of all such permutations (you may list the signed permutations in any order).
